# final-game

Summary of Project Goals:
	Dungeon Escape is a text-based game. The players must find their way through a randomly generated dungeon rooms, while possibly fighting enemies/monsters, and collecting items to help them escape before their health empties. This game has a turn-based combat style, randomly generated dungeon layouts, and an inventory for the player where they can collect different potions, weapons, and keys to help them with their journey. 

Instructions for Players:
	Type 1-5 for choosing direction of travel
		1 = go north
		2 = go south
		3 = go east
		4 = go west
		5 = quit
	If you run into an enemy type 1-3 to choose what you want to do
		1 = attack
		2 = defend
		3 = use item

Objective of the Game: find your way through the dungeon without emptying your health. You will battle enemies, collect items, fight off monsters, and try and survive until you escape.

Technologies Used:
	Python: the main program running my code
	Random Module: used to generate dungeon
	Time Module: used for turn delays or defense

Description of Process:
	1. I started off by designing my game outside of code and made sure I had my whole idea planned out
	2. I then figured out what kind of challenges I wanted in the game, what enemies/monsters
	3. I started my coding in stages, first figuring out exactly what and how I wanted the player movement to work and how I wanted the dungeon to be generated
	4. Next I chose to use a turn-based combat style and have the dungeon be randomly generated
	5. I made sure to run the program frequently to make sure it was working smoothly and correctly

Challenges I Faced:
	I definitely struggled when implementing the turn-based combat system, It took me a while before I could correctly figure out how to make sure that the player would be able to defend and attack properly. 

What I Learned:
	I learned how to make my own game from scratch
	I also learned how to make random generation work in the ways that I wanted to

What I Would Like to Improve:
	I would have liked to figure out how to add more complex enemies to make the game harder to defeat
	I would also have liked to figure out how to add more players so that two people could play together

What I Would Do Differently:
	I would spend more time trying to figure out how to make the game more complex

How Far I Strayed: 
	I would like to think that I stayed pretty much in line with the game design document that I made

How I Stayed on Track:
	I set a schedule for myself to make sure I would not get far behind 
	I also made sure to work on the game a little bit everyday to make sure that I had plenty of time to make sure that the game was made the way I planned/imagined
